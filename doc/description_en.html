<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color:red">Live</span></strong> is a monitoring station for inverters
    <strong>SOLAX
        X3-HYBRID G3/G4</strong>, <strong>GoodWe ET</strong> a <strong>SOFAR SOLAR HYD</strong>.</p>
<p>It displays live data from the inverter:</p>
<ul>
    <li>energy flow - clearly shows panel output, household consumption, battery status, and even inverter temperature
    </li>
    <li>statistics - how much energy was produced, consumed, purchased, and sold today</li>
    <li>graph - production, consumption, and battery status for the last 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<q>What can be set up, can break.</q>
<p>That’s why <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color:red">Live</span></strong> is designed so the user doesn’t have to
    set up anything. The station automatically connects to your inverter’s WiFi and starts displaying data.</p>

<h2>Before purchasing</h2>
<p>Ensure that there is an available WiFi network from the inverter at the location where you want to use the station:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SOLAX</strong> - Only installations with a WiFi Dongle are supported. The Dongle broadcasts WiFi named
        WiFi_XXXXXX, where XXXXXX
        is
        the
        serial
        number of the dongle. This network must be unsecured by a password - the default state. If such a network is not
        available, it may still
        be
        hidden - this can be verified and set up in the SolaxCloud mobile app.</li>
    <li><strong>GoodWe</strong> - The GoodWe inverter broadcasts a WiFi network named Solar-WifiXXXXXX, where XXXXXX is
        the serial number
        of the dongle. This
        WiFi is
        normally secured by a password <code>12345678</code>. Please check that you can connect to this network using
        that password.</li>
    <li><strong>SOFAR SOLAR</strong> - The SOFAR SOLAR inverter broadcasts a WiFi network named AP-XXXXXX, where XXXXXX
        is the serial number of the dongle. This WiFi network is typically secured with a password printed on the WiFi
        dongle. Please ensure you can connect to this network using that password.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first version, only typical household photovoltaic (PV) installations with the listed inverters and battery
    support will be supported. This means multi-inverter installations will not be supported yet (for now).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation is very simple. Just plug the station into the socket using the included cable. The station will
    automatically connect to
    the inverter and start displaying data right away. <strong>That's it!</strong></p>
<h2>Firmware update</h2>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color:red">Live</span></strong> does NOT come with automatic firmware updates,
    unlike other projects. The device is designed in such a way that if it works now, it will still work
    in 5 years. However, firmware updates can still be performed using a USB-C cable and a browser.</p>

<h2>SOLAR PLUG</h2>
<p>All sold SOLAR PLUG sockets are supported. After connecting the SOLAR PLUG, <strong>SOLAR STATION <span
            style="color:red">Live</span></strong> will automatically pair with it and a new tile will appear. The
    sockets are
    automatically switched according to internal rules to maximize the use of solar energy.</p>
