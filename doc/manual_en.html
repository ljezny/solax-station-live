<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> is designed for automatic connection to
    your inverter without the need for manual configuration.</p>

<p>However, if <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> does not find a compatible WiFi
    network,
    it will display a selection menu of available supported WiFi networks. Only inverter networks are displayed, not
    your home WiFi
    network.</p>

<p>Select the correct inverter and, if necessary, enter the WiFi network password. <strong>SOLAR STATION <span
            style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> will save the password.</p>

<h2>Firmware Update</h2>
<p>First, check which version of <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> you have.</p>
<p>If you have a RESET button on the back, it is the 2nd generation. The firmware for the 1st and 2nd generations is
    different (different display controller). However, if you accidentally flash the wrong firmware, uploading the
    correct one will fix it – nothing will be broken.</p>

<p>Some daily statistics may show zeros for certain inverters (Victron, GoodWe) after startup. This is because
    the inverter does not record this daily statistic. <strong>SOLAR STATION <span
            style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> calculates it itself from the overall statistics and therefore
    it appears only after midnight.</p>

<h1>Supported Inverters</h1>

<h2>SOLAX</h2>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> automatically connects to
    the inverter using default settings by default. If this does not happen, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check if a WiFi network named <em>Wifi_XXXXXX</em> (WiFi network broadcasted by the inverter dongle) is
        available. If
        it is not visible, it might be hidden – disable network hiding in the SOLAX Cloud mobile app (Menu -> Settings
        ->
        Network -> Pocket WiFi SSID Broadcast).</li>
    <li>The dongle's WiFi network is not password protected, but API access is secured. The default API password is
        printed on the WiFi
        dongle and starts with the letter "S".</li>
</ol>

<h2>GOODWE</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Check the availability of the WiFi network <em>SolarWifiXXXXXX</em> (XXXXXX corresponds to the dongle's serial
        number). The default
        password for this network is <strong>12345678</strong>.</li>
    <li>If the dongle does not respond, reset it by pressing the button briefly and wait about 3 minutes for it to
        restart.</li>
</ol>

<h2>VICTRON</h2>
<p>The Victron inverter broadcasts the WiFi network <em>venus-XXXXXX</em> (XXXXXX corresponds to the dongle's serial
    number). Connecting to this network
    requires the password provided on the dongle.</p>
<p>For proper functioning, it is necessary to activate <strong>Modbus TCP</strong> in the device menu (Menu -> Settings
    -> Services ->
    Modbus TCP).</p>

    <h1>SOLAR PLUG</h1>
    <p>All SOLAR PLUG outlets and relays are fully compatible.</p>
    <p>We always deliver the outlet already in pairing mode. Just plug the outlet into the power, and the station will find and connect it automatically.</p>
    <p>If for some reason you need to put the outlet into pairing mode, you can trigger this at any time by holding the button on the outlet for 10 seconds (the blue indicator will light up).</p>
    <p>Pairing the outlet may take several minutes. If you want to speed it up, you can restart the station. But even then, the outlet will be found.</p>
    <p>The paired outlet is not connected to your home network or the internet. It is exclusively controlled by the <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> station. Therefore, it cannot be connected to the original Shelly app.</p>
    <p>During configuration, the indicators change:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> active pairing mode</li>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> configuration in progress</li>
        <li><strong>Orange:</strong> device is successfully connected and active.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After successful pairing, the outlet will appear in the home consumption overview.</p>
    <h2>Switching the Outlet</h2>
    <p>The <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> station automatically switches the outlets according to internal rules. <strong>You don’t set anything manually.</strong> The energy balance is monitored and the charged home battery is given priority. Once the home battery is charged or surplus power is available, the station will gradually switch on the individual outlets in a cascading manner. The outlets will then remain on for at least 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>When an outlet is switched on, electricity may be drawn from the battery, but only for a maximum of 5 minutes. In cases of borderline output from the photovoltaic system (FVE), the outlets are cyclically switched off, thus maximizing the utilization of energy from the photovoltaic system.</p>

<h1>SOLAR PLUG</h1>
<p>All SOLAR PLUG sockets are fully compatible. Once connected to the network, they are automatically detected and
    displayed in the
    household consumption statistics.</p>
<p>First-time setup activates pairing mode. Pairing can be initiated at any time by holding the button on the socket for
    10 seconds
    (the blue indicator light will turn on).</p>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> automatically searches for and pairs
    available
    SOLAR PLUG units. During configuration, the indicators change as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blue:</strong> active pairing mode</li>
    <li><strong>Orange:</strong> configuration in progress</li>
    <li><strong>Green:</strong> device successfully connected and active</li>
</ul>
<p>After successful pairing, the socket will appear in the household consumption overview.</p>
