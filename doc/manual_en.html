<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> is designed for automatic connection to
    your inverter without the need for manual configuration.</p>

<p>However, if <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> does not find a compatible WiFi network,
    it will display a selection menu of available supported WiFi networks. Only inverter networks are displayed, not your home WiFi
    network.</p>

<p>Select the correct inverter and, if necessary, enter the WiFi network password. <strong>SOLAR STATION <span
            style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> will save the password.</p>

<p>Some daily statistics may show zeros for certain inverters (Victron, GoodWe) after startup. This is because
    the inverter does not record this daily statistic. <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> calculates it itself from the overall statistics and therefore it appears only after midnight.</p>
    
<h1>Supported Inverters</h1>

<h2>SOLAX</h2>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> automatically connects to
    the inverter using default settings by default. If this does not happen, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check if a WiFi network named <em>Wifi_XXXXXX</em> (WiFi network broadcasted by the inverter dongle) is available. If
        it is not visible, it might be hidden â€“ disable network hiding in the SOLAX Cloud mobile app (Menu -> Settings ->
        Network -> Pocket WiFi SSID Broadcast).</li>
    <li>The dongle's WiFi network is not password protected, but API access is secured. The default API password is printed on the WiFi
        dongle and starts with the letter "S".</li>
</ol>

<h2>GOODWE</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Check the availability of the WiFi network <em>SolarWifiXXXXXX</em> (XXXXXX corresponds to the dongle's serial number). The default
        password for this network is <strong>12345678</strong>.</li>
    <li>If the dongle does not respond, reset it by pressing the button briefly and wait about 3 minutes for it to restart.</li>
</ol>

<h2>VICTRON</h2>
<p>The Victron inverter broadcasts the WiFi network <em>venus-XXXXXX</em> (XXXXXX corresponds to the dongle's serial number). Connecting to this network
    requires the password provided on the dongle.</p>
<p>For proper functioning, it is necessary to activate <strong>Modbus TCP</strong> in the device menu (Menu -> Settings -> Services ->
    Modbus TCP).</p>

<h1>SOLAR PLUG</h1>
<p>All SOLAR PLUG sockets are fully compatible. Once connected to the network, they are automatically detected and displayed in the
    household consumption statistics.</p>
<p>First-time setup activates pairing mode. Pairing can be initiated at any time by holding the button on the socket for 10 seconds
    (the blue indicator light will turn on).</p>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> automatically searches for and pairs available
    SOLAR PLUG units. During configuration, the indicators change as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blue:</strong> active pairing mode</li>
    <li><strong>Orange:</strong> configuration in progress</li>
    <li><strong>Green:</strong> device successfully connected and active</li>
</ul>
<p>After successful pairing, the socket will appear in the household consumption overview.</p>
