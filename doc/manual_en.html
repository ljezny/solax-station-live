<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> is designed for automatic connection to
    your inverter without the need for manual configuration.</p>

<p>However, if <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> does not find a compatible WiFi network,
    it will display a selection menu of available supported WiFi networks. Only inverter networks are displayed, not your home WiFi
    network.</p>

<p>Select the correct inverter and, if necessary, enter the WiFi network password. <strong>SOLAR STATION <span
            style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> will save the password.</p>

<p>Some daily statistics may show zeros for certain inverters (Victron, GoodWe) after startup. This is because
    the inverter does not record this daily statistic. <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> calculates it itself from the overall statistics and therefore it appears only after midnight.</p>
    
<h1>Supported Inverters</h1>

<h2>SOLAX</h2>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> automatically connects to
    the inverter using default settings by default. If this does not happen, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check if a WiFi network named <em>Wifi_XXXXXX</em> (WiFi network broadcasted by the inverter dongle) is available. If
        it is not visible, it might be hidden – disable network hiding in the SOLAX Cloud mobile app (Menu -> Settings ->
        Network -> Pocket WiFi SSID Broadcast).</li>
    <li>The dongle's WiFi network is not password protected, but API access is secured. The default API password is printed on the WiFi
        dongle and starts with the letter "S".</li>
</ol>

<h2>GOODWE</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Check the availability of the WiFi network <em>SolarWifiXXXXXX</em> (XXXXXX corresponds to the dongle's serial number). The default
        password for this network is <strong>12345678</strong>.</li>
    <li>If the dongle does not respond, reset it by pressing the button briefly and wait about 3 minutes for it to restart.</li>
</ol>

<h2>VICTRON</h2>
<p>The Victron inverter broadcasts the WiFi network <em>venus-XXXXXX</em> (XXXXXX corresponds to the dongle's serial number). Connecting to this network
    requires the password provided on the dongle.</p>
<p>For proper functioning, it is necessary to activate <strong>Modbus TCP</strong> in the device menu (Menu -> Settings -> Services ->
    Modbus TCP).</p>

    <h1>SOLAR PLUG</h1>
    <p>All SOLAR PLUG outlets and relays are fully compatible.</p>
    <p>We always deliver the outlet already in pairing mode. Just plug the outlet into the power, and the station will find and connect it automatically.</p>
    <p>If for some reason you need to put the outlet into pairing mode, you can trigger this at any time by holding the button on the outlet for 10 seconds (the blue indicator will light up).</p>
    <p>Pairing the outlet may take several minutes. If you want to speed it up, you can restart the station. But even then, the outlet will be found.</p>
    <p>The paired outlet is not connected to your home network or the internet. It is exclusively controlled by the <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> station. Therefore, it cannot be connected to the original Shelly app.</p>
    <p>During configuration, the indicators change:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> active pairing mode</li>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> configuration in progress</li>
        <li><strong>Orange:</strong> device is successfully connected and active.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After successful pairing, the outlet will appear in the home consumption overview.</p>
    <h2>Switching the Outlet</h2>
    <p>The <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIVE</span></strong> station automatically switches the outlets according to internal rules. <strong>You don’t set anything manually.</strong> The energy balance is monitored and the charged home battery is given priority. Once the home battery is charged or surplus power is available, the station will gradually switch on the individual outlets in a cascading manner. The outlets will then remain on for at least 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>When an outlet is switched on, electricity may be drawn from the battery, but only for a maximum of 5 minutes. In cases of borderline output from the photovoltaic system (FVE), the outlets are cyclically switched off, thus maximizing the utilization of energy from the photovoltaic system.</p>
