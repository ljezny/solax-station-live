<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color:red">Live</span></strong> is a monitoring station for inverters:
    <li> <strong>SOLAX X3-HYBRID G3/G4</strong></li>
    <li><strong>GoodWe ET series</strong></li>
    <li><strong>SOFAR SOLAR HYD</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Victron</strong></li>
    <li><strong>DEYE</strong></li>
    <li><strong>GROWATT SPH</strong></li>
</p>
<p>It displays live data from the inverter:</p>
<ul>
    <li>energy flow - a clear overview of panel performance, household consumption, battery status, and even the inverter's temperature</li>
    <li>statistics - how much energy was produced, consumed, purchased, and sold today</li>
    <li>graph - production, consumption, and battery status over the past 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<q>What can be set, can go wrong.</q>
<p>That’s why <strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color:red">Live</span></strong> is designed so that the user doesn’t need to set anything. The station automatically connects to the inverter’s WiFi and starts displaying data.</p>

<h2>Before purchasing</h2>
<p>Make sure that the inverter's WiFi network is available in the location where you want to use the station:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SOLAX</strong> - Only installations with a WiFi Dongle are supported. The Dongle emits a WiFi network named WiFi_XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is the dongle's serial number. This network must be unsecured by default. If such a network is not available, it might still be hidden - you can verify and configure this in the SolaxCloud mobile app.</li>
    <li><strong>GoodWe</strong> - The GoodWe inverter emits a WiFi network named Solar-WifiXXXXXX, where XXXXXX is the dongle's serial number. This network is secured by default with the password <code>12345678</code>. Please check if you can connect to this network using the password.</li>
    <li><strong>SOFAR SOLAR, DEYE</strong> - The SOFAR SOLAR, DEYE inverter emits a WiFi network named AP-XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is the dongle's serial number. This WiFi network is secured by default with a password printed on the WiFi dongle. Please ensure you can connect to this network using the password.</li>
    <li><strong>Victron</strong> - The Victron inverter emits a WiFi network named venus-XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is the dongle's serial number. This WiFi network is secured by default with a password printed on the WiFi dongle. Please ensure you can connect to this network using the password. Additionally, Modbus TCP must be enabled via the remote console (Menu/Settings/Services/Modbus TCP - enable).</li>
    <li><strong>Growatt</strong> via your home Wi-Fi network. The Shine WiFi-X dongle must be updated to at least version 3.1.1.1 (in which MODBUS TCP is enabled).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the initial version, only typical home FVE installations with the listed inverters with batteries will be supported. Multi-inverter installations will not be supported yet.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation is very simple. Just plug the station into a socket using the included cable. The station will automatically connect to the inverter and start displaying data. <strong>That’s it!</strong></p>
<h2>Firmware update</h2>
<p><strong>SOLAR STATION <span style="color:red">Live</span></strong> does NOT feature automatic firmware updates like other projects. The device is designed so that if it works now, it will work even in 5 years. However, firmware can still be updated manually using a USB-C cable and a browser.</p>
<h2>SOLAR PLUG</h2>
<p>All SOLAR PLUG sockets sold are supported. Once the SOLAR PLUG is connected, <strong>SOLAR STATION <span
            style="color:red">Live</span></strong> will automatically pair it, and a new tile will appear. Sockets are automatically switched according to internal rules to maximize the use of solar energy.</p>
